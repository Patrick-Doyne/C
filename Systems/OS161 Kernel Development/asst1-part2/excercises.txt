1) Assume that the residents of Podunk are exceptional and follow the old (and widely ignored) convention that whoever arrives at the intersection first 
proceeds first. Using the language of synchronization primitives describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this method suboptimal?

ANSWER: This is a waste of available resources because they are waiting for the car to make EITHER a left OR right turn, but depedning on the choice
resources could be wasted. For example if car 1 approaches from route A and car 2 from B and car 3 from C all at the same time with A coming a hair before B
and B a hair before C and car 1 turns right and the other cars both want to turn right as well this causes 2/3 of the resources to be wasted! (i.e. suboptimal approach)

2)Now, assume that the residents of Podunk are like most people and do not follow the convention described above. In what one instance can this three-way-stop
 intersection produce a deadlock? (It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize an actual intersection).

 ANSWER: If a car from rotes A, B, and C all have one car enter at the same time and all 3 cars want to turn left then none will be able to proceed. They will all be
 waiitng for the second lock needed to transfer() i.e. a deadlock.
