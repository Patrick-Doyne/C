# *Directory Overview for Recruiters*

Welcome! This repository is structured to showcase skills and experience in two fundamental areas of computer science and software engineering: **Low Level Programming** and **Systems**. Below is a description of each subdirectory, designed to help recruiters quickly understand the content and its relevance.

## *Low Level Programming*

This directory highlights expertise in working close to the hardware, demonstrating a strong understanding of computer architecture and performance optimization. Contents typically include:

- **C Programming Samples:** Code illustrating memory management, pointer arithmetic, and efficient data handling.
- **IEEE-Like Systems Work:** Projects that interface with microcontrollers or custom hardware.
- **Performance Tuning:** Demonstrations of profiling, benchmarking, and optimizing software at a low level.

These materials are intended to demonstrate proficiency in foundational programming skills, critical for roles requiring a deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware.

## *Systems*

This directory showcases experience in building and maintaining large-scale, robust software systems. It includes:

- **Operating Systems Concepts:** Source code and documentation reflecting knowledge of OS fundamentals.
- **Networking Projects:** Examples of communication protocols, socket programming, and distributed systems.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism:** Code samples illustrating the design and implementation of multi-threaded or parallel applications.

These projects highlight the ability to work at the systems level, including designing scalable architectures, managing resources, and solving complex technical challenges.
